# Customer-Segmentation-Project_1
In this project I use python  for data cleaning ,EDA and model development. I use K-means  clustring to idetify high yeilding customers.

The ultimate goal is to:

Identify 'Target Customers' (i.e., customer clusters that show high income and high spending score).

Understand the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., "Young adults with low income but high spending").

Provide actionable insights to your marketing team so they can tailor promotions, product placements, and advertising campaigns to each specific group.
